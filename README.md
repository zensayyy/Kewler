# Kewler

## Motivation

**Kewler** is a project that aims to simplify Continuous Delivery (GitOps) for projects that don't want to use container workload ochestration such as my personal projects that run on rather cheap hardware. Here, K8s can intruduce uncessary overhead and complexity when *doing it the old way* is just enough. However, it would still be nice to have some orchestration and GitOps like capabilities. Thus I decided to implement **Kewler**.
